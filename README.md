# CareerTracker
The Career Tracker is a web application that would help the school of Natural Sciences at Indiana University Southeast keep track of their alumni.
This application makes it easier for the school of Natural Sciences to upload the graduation report they receive from the registrar at the end of every semester. This report comes in the form of a huge spreadsheet.
The office of the Dean would like to have an application that can sort this spreadsheet and only store certain fields into the database. This information from such document would allow the school to keep in touch with former students and be able to invite them to reunions, meetings, etc.
To build this web application, Team Blue will use the following tools: Angular, Node JS, and MySQL.
